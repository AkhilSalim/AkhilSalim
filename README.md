- 👋 Hi, I’m @AkhilSalim
- 👀 I’m interested in the physics of the universe, but one thing at a time. I'm currently invested in nearshore oceanography and coastal engineering.
- 🌱 I’m learning XBeach and Delft3D, and working on data assimilation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data assimilation projects as well as design of sustainable coastal structures and coastal restoration projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: salima@oregonstate.edu
